**A complete guide to helping you build innovative full-scale prototype projects using Raspberry Pi and MQTT protocol**

## What is this book about?
The future of IoT has the potential to be limitless. Wouldn’t it be great if you could add this to your known technological stacks. But, where to start? Of course, with the basics. 

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Configure and use a Raspberry Pi for IoT projects
* Implement the MQTT communication protocol for projects
* Understand how to set up the NodeMCU and ESP32 boards as MQTT clients
* Control a NodeMCU board through a Node-RED dashboard hosted on Raspberry Pi
* Get LAMP server, Home Assistant, and MariaDB on the Raspberry Pi
* Set up an online MQTT broker on a cloud service or enterprise service provider platform
* Build full-scale, end-to-end prototype projects

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter 4.

The code will look like the following:
```
void setup ()
{
pinMode (LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}
```

Any command-line input or output is written as follows:
```
sudo apt install mosquitto mosquitto-clients
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for students who are interested in IoT and want to build projects using the available developer hardware. Educators who want to introduce a course on IoT into their curriculum, technology enthusiasts, and IoT developers who are just getting started will also benefit from this book. No prior knowledge about the two main topics that the book covers is required - Raspberry Pi and MQTT. A basic understanding of what IoT is will also be useful but not mandatory.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-9).
### Software and Hardware List
|   Hardware covered in the book | Operating System requirements |
